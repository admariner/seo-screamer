## Why did I build this
Tools like Screaming Frog, Google PageSpeed, Google Search Console, Google Analytics eg provide website owners with a lot of information. Mostly unreadable / human impossible to understand data. With this script I'm trying to create an easy way to pull all information into one readable, easy to understand document.

## Build status
Build status of far from ready :-) It spits out a word document. But we are a long way from home!
